# Why

I have always loved the idea of getting a web server up with minimal effort so that I can fiddle with frameworks. I am an
ASP.NET developer and haven't had this option. I really loved other frameworks such as [nodejs](https://nodejs.org "Node.js Homepage")
because you can quickly and from the command line, create a static web server that is fast an responsive. Although the current version
of AspNetCore (RC2 is the current version) is not as feature rich as the NPM echosystem, I think it is a giant step in the right
direction, IMHO.

I am very excited to see where this goes in the future!
